# Option 1 - Just check for updates and blast every cask that needs new updates

# use xargs so that the output of the first command is used as args and not stdin
# brew cask list | xargs brew cask install --force

# Option 2 - Require some review & provide option to exit after gracefully uninstalling packages before installing updates

# brew_cask_upgrade() { 

#  if [ "$1" != '--continue' ]; then 
#    echo "Removing brew cache" 
#    rm -rf "$(brew --cache)" 
#    echo "Running brew update" 
#    brew update 
#  fi 
#  for c in $(brew cask list); do 
#    echo -e "\n\nInstalled versions of $c: " 
#    ls /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/$c 
#    echo "Cask info for $c" 
#    brew cask info $c 
#    select ynx in "Yes" "No" "Exit"; do  
#     case $ynx in 
#        "Yes") echo "Uninstalling $c"; brew cask uninstall --force "$c"; echo "Re-installing $c"; brew cask install "$c"; break;; 
#        "No") echo "Skipping $c"; break;; 
#        "Exit") echo "Exiting brew-cask-upgrade"; return;;
